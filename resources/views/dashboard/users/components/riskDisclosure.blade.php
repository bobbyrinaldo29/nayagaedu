                    <span class="s1">Work in the international currency market involves high profit as well
                        as a high degree of risks due to fluctuation in prices, which cannot always be accurately
                        predicted. Therefore, before starting to trade you need to clearly understand that trading of
                        currencies and other instruments by using leverage is associated with high degree of risk and
                        may not be suitable for all investors. This document covers main risks a Forex trader may face,
                        and sets out the rules governing work in the foreign currency market. </span>

                    <li class="li8">
                        <span class="s1"><strong>1.1.</strong> High leverage and low margin can lead to the
                            loss of funds due to
                            price fluctuation. Even minor movement in the Forex market will have proportionally much
                            higher
                            impact on the funds involved in trading because of the use of leverage. In case market moves
                            in
                            the opposite direction against the position opened by you and/or in case the value of the
                            required margin increases, you will urgently need to deposit additional money as required. A
                            client shall clearly realize that his/her inability to maintain loss-making positions may
                            result
                            in losing part or all of the invested funds in the event of adverse changes in exchange
                            rates of
                            currencies or other tools.<br /></span>

                            for the use of limit orders (for example, stop-loss), which are aimed at limiting losses in
                            case
                            of changes/price movement against the position opened by a Client.<br /></span>

                            the lack of liquidity), as well as market
                            specific conditions (time of transaction, work hours of the market, etc.) can increase the
                            chances of losing funds, and may make it impossible to place limit orders or close
                            position.<br /></span>

                            of conducting transactions in the market
                            under the jurisdiction of a foreign country, such transactions shall be in accordance with
                            the
                            rules and regulations of that country, and thus these may offer different or diminished
                            levels
                            of protection. Therefore, prior to starting to trade in the Forex market the Client is
                            required
                            to learn and be familiar with the types of compensation and rules applicable under
                            jurisdiction
                            of the Client’s country or in other relevant jurisdictions. It is important to remember that
                            local regulatory authority of the Client will not be able to force the markets under other
                            jurisdictions comply with the laws ruling in the Client’s country, if trades have been
                            conducted

                        market instability, the Company is not liable for the losses incurred by the Client, due to
                        sharp decline in liquidity and changes in price trend, associated with outbreak of hostilities,
                        natural disasters, acts of terrorism, suspension of currency trading, etc., and which is beyond
                        the control of the brokerage company.<br /><br /></span>

                    <span class="s1">Note also, that due to the high risks involved in
                        trading in the Forex currency market, a trader should not carry out trading operations in the
                        absence of sufficient funds to maintain open positions, which he/she can afford to
                        lose.<br /><br /></span>

                    <span class="s1">Forex trader aims at increasing capital; therefore, the more money
                        he/she deposits in his/her trading account, the faster he/she gains profit in case of successful
                        transactions. However, in the event that a trader has invested funds for conducting trading
                        operations, the loss of which can adversely affect the life of this trader, he/she will find it
                        difficult to preserve emotional control needed for achieving success in
                        trading.<br /><br /></span>
